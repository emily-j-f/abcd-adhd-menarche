# abcd-adhd-menarche
These are all the R code files for a study investigating how menarche might be associated with changes in ADHD traits in the general adolescent population and whether it moderates mental health outcomes in adolescents with ADHD vs those without. Comparative analyses were also performed to see if effects differ between menarche and breast development. Data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study release 5.1 were used for all analyses.

Follow these steps to repeat the study:

1. [Data processing](https://github.com/emily-j-f/abcd-adhd-menarche/tree/main/1.%20ABCD%20data%20processing)
2. Generate [descriptive statistics](https://github.com/emily-j-f/abcd-adhd-menarche/tree/main/2.%20Descriptives)
3. Perform the [main analyses](https://github.com/emily-j-f/abcd-adhd-menarche/tree/main/3.%20Analyses%20(Bayesian%20GLMM)) (Bayesian generalised linear mixed models)
4. Peform [sensitivity analyses](https://github.com/emily-j-f/abcd-adhd-menarche/tree/main/4.%20Sensitivity%20analyses) to test the robustness of effects

Outputs for all models can be found in this [subfolder](https://github.com/emily-j-f/abcd-adhd-menarche/tree/main/3.%20Analyses%20(Bayesian%20GLMM)/Model%20outputs)
